# AVR Digital Watch With Alarm
This project implements an digital watch using the AVR archticture, the key features of this project is setting the clock in HH:MM:SS format in 24-hour notation and also 
setting the alarm, when the alarm time equals the clock the buzzer goes off.

## ⚡Components
 The following components have been used:
 * ATMEGA32 MCU
 * Buzzer
 * 2*16 LCD
 * Keypad

## 🛠️Drivers
In order to achive the project funtionality I wrote the following drivers:
* DIO
* Buzzer
* LCD
* Keypad
these drivers can be found in /src forlder

## 👨‍💻Simulation
The proteus simulation design can be found in (design.DSN) file, here is the simulation in action:
